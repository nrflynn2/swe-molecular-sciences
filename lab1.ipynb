    "## Motivation of Virtual Screening\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual screening (VS) is a computational framework to predict and prioritize compounds as drug candidates by simulating their interactions with a target receptor or predicting other properties relevant to drug discovery, thereby reducing the number of compounds that need to be experimentally tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual screening is much faster and cheaper than experimental screening; we can test a magnitude of $10^9$ to $10^{12}$ compounds per day (equivalent to at least ~3 years of experimental screening per day of virtual screening). \n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation of molecular dynamics or molecular docking are examples of VS approaches based on first principles of physical processes, such as intermolecular force fields, to discern how the compound or ligand might move around in physical space or reorient its structure to bind with the target."

    "## Virtual Screening Taxonomy\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual screening pipelines are often hierarchical, proceeding with a broad, large number of compounds through simpler, less restrictive, and computationally cheaper processes to whittle down the quantity of compounds for more complex processes. The simplest filters include compound filters for drug-likeness and known structural alerts. Since lead optimization results in an increase in molecular complexity, filters that assess lead-likeliness or desired ADMET properties may also be applied to discourage compounds that would necessitate too many changes during lead optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "After use of chemical compound filters, virtual screening methods are broadly categorized depending on the information we have available about the target and its 3D structure. If we have the target’s 3D structure available, we can perform structure-based methods such as protein-ligand docking. By “3D structures,” we mean that previous experiments (using techniques such as X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) have determined the target’s structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a defined target structure is unavailable, either from a database such as PDB or from our own experiments, then we can still take advantage of ligand-based methods. If we have just one active compound, we can perform a similarity search: screen the active compound against a library of other compounds to identify which compounds are like the active compound. Intuitively, compounds with similar structures or properties to a known active compound have a higher chance of being active. If we have several known, active compounds, then we can also conduct a ligand-based pharmacophore search (in addition to a similarity search). In pharmacophore searching, we take our list of active compounds, generate possible configurations of their 3D shape, and try to align these possible configurations to find common structural features shared by the different active compounds. We can score structural features with high commonality and conduct a search for which of our unknown compounds have high-scoring features.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have many known, active compounds as well as known, inactive compounds, then we can enter the realm of machine learning (ML) methods. In ligand-based machine learning, our goal is to train a model that can identify a correlation between the structural features of the compounds in our dataset and how they relate to the compound’s activity. If our model can discriminate between known active and inactive compounds, we hope it’s performance will generalize to new compounds that weren’t in the training dataset. Machine learning models for predicting compound activity are sometimes referred to as quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models (though not all QSAR models are ML models). Quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) is the more general term that refers to quantifying the relationship between structure and any molecular property.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also common to use multiple virtual screening methods, one after the other, of increasing complexity. This approach is referred to as hierarchical virtual screening. Each step filters out more structures of no further interest, until at the end of the process a series of candidate structures remain. For example, we can use rule-based compound filters to rapidly screen out the most egregious candidates, followed by ligand-based virtual screening as a more nuanced detector of active compounds. Remaining compounds can then be subject to more rigorous and intensive structure-based methods, e.g., protein-ligand docking or molecular dynamics simulations, with one or more targets of interest."

    "We’ll show how to use ligand-based virtual screening to evaluate compounds for antimalarial potential based on the similarity of their structures to known antimalarial compounds. Malaria is a life-threatening parasitic disease that affects millions of people worldwide, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a major global health problem, causing a significant number of deaths, particularly among young children and pregnant women. Developing effective antimalarial drugs can directly contribute to reducing malaria’s global health burden and negative economic impact. \n",
    "Antimalarial drug research often focuses on various protein targets within Plasmodium falciparum, which is the most common vector of malaria. These protein targets are critical to its survival, replication, and invasion of host cells. An ominous threat to controlling malaria is P. falciparum’s ability to adapt and develop resistance to antimalarial drugs. Drugs that were once effective in treating malaria can become ineffective over time, and new therapeutics are repeatedly necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will initiate a virtual screening campaign to identify antimalarial drug candidates, evoking recent successes for inspiration. We will begin with a sizable quantity of novel molecules and filter out substances that lack drug-like qualities or have detrimental properties, such as toxicity risk. To initiate the screen, we will start with a diverse range of >212K small molecules made available by PubChem from the SPECS repository, casting a wide net over chemical space. A key feature of SPECS is commercial availability – desirable compounds for downstream experiments are synthesizable and conveniently available for purchase. There are many other commercial vendors offering millions of compounds that meet a variety of characteristics and are purchasable, e.g., ChemBridge, eMolecules, Enamine, Life Chemicals, and Maybridge. \n",

To identify promising hit compounds, we will conduct a similarity search to cross-reference our diverse chemical library against the Malaria Box. In later chapters, we will consider how to optimize and develop discovered hits into potential antimalarial drugs."

    "3. Search Strategy: If there is one reference, we may only care about the most similar molecule(s). But if there are multiple references, how should we prioritize a molecule based on its aggregate similarity to all available reference compounds? What if we want a search strategy that can accommodate new molecules that we might consider later? Furthermore, molecules can be similar in different ways. How do we factor this into our search? Which features are meaningful for similarity comparison?\n",

In general, our similarity metric measures the extent of shared features between molecule pairs.

As an example, the following figure exemplifies the nuances in structure-property relationships that make similarity searching a challenging task."

The simplest connection table defines enough information to generate a molecule as a graph, where nodes are atoms and edges are bonds. This only requires an atom table and a bond table.\n",

    "An atom table indexes each atom. A bond table designates the two atoms involved in each bond and the type of bond. Bond orders of 1, 2, and 3 correspond to single bonds, double bonds, and triple bonds, respectively. Hydrogens may be implicitly or explicitly defined. The former is not an issue as algorithms exist that can determine the number of hydrogens. Also note that connection tables are not unique – we could derive a different, but equivalent connection table by swapping the indices of two atoms and their bonds.\n",
    "To express meaningful chemical information cohesively and explicitly, SDFs extend connection tables to incorporate 2D or 3D spatial information and information associated with individual atoms or bonds and the entire structure. The most common SDF format is based on the MOL file format developed by Molecular Design Limited (MDL), of which the V2000 and V3000 formats are often used.\n",

The count block tells us there are 9 atoms, 9 bonds, no chirality, and that the file format is V2000. The atom block contains X, Y, Z coordinates of each atom and the atom symbol. The additional columns may encode property information, but a separate properties block is usually used instead.

    "Promiscuous bioactive compounds, or PAINS compounds, appear active in many high-throughput screening experiments against a broad, diverse range of targets. PAINS are often false positive hits and mislead results in biological assays, producing artifacts in the data. These “frequent hitters” exhibit a propensity to bind to multiple targets due to nonspecific binding or interference with the specific assay technology readouts. PAINS filters are composed of substructures that are associated with PAINS. Conveniently, RDKit maintains pre-defined PAINS filters we can easily use to filter our compound library.\n",

In this context, we will assemble a set of structural alerts that have a known association with toxic endpoints. For example, thiophene, epoxides, and acid anhydrides are common structural alerts used to identify risk of hepatotoxicity, mutagenicity, or skin sensitization, respectively. If a compound contains several structural alerts greater than a user-defined threshold, it is filtered out.\n",

Inversely, a smaller radius of 2 highlights the immediate neighborhood of each atom and is more likely to capture specific functional groups, local arrangements of atoms, or other fine-grained details of molecular structure. Calculating Morgan fingerprints with a smaller radius is computationally cheaper, which is pedagogically beneficial since it is easier to modify the example code and produce new results.

A starting library of over 212K small molecules seems much smaller once we realize how few hits might result after application of property, substructure, and similarity filters.\n",
