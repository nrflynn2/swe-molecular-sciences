    "### The Challenge\n",
    "Simple ranking by binding energy alone often misses promising compounds because:\n",
    "1. Scoring functions have inherent errors (~2 kcal/mol)\n",
    "2. Enthalpic contributions (H-bonds) may outweigh entropic penalties\n",
    "3. Pose quality (RMSD) affects reliability of predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pareto Optimization Approach\n",
    "We implement multi-parameter optimization using a weighted scoring function that balances all parameters. While production systems use O(n log n) sorting for millions of compounds, selection sort's O(n²) complexity is acceptable for teaching the importance of multi-objective optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "If curious to learn more about pareto frontier, see https://www.mayerowitz.io/blog/mario-meets-pareto\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "The code below demonstrates:\n",
    "1. Selection sort implementation with custom comparison keys\n",
    "2. Single-parameter ranking (binding energy only)\n",
    "3. Multi-parameter Pareto scoring\n",
    "4. Comparison of ranking differences"
