        "\n",
        "Before you can begin to develop database applications, you need to\n",
        "understand the basic concepts. Relational databases hold data. This data\n",
        "can be of different types, such as numbers, characters, or dates. Within\n",
        "the database, the data are organized into logical units called tables. A\n",
        "table is like a spreadsheet, because it contains rows of data. Each row\n",
        "is made up of a number of columns. The columns hold data of a specific\n",
        "data type, like integer values or strings of characters. In most cases,\n",
        "a database has more than one table. To relate the tables together, a\n",
        "database designer takes advantage of natural (or artificial) links\n",
        "between the tables. In a spreadsheet, you can link rows in different\n",
        "sheets by cell values. The same idea holds in a relational database, and\n",
        "the column used to make the link is referred to as a key column.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make it easier to understand the purpose of a table or a particular\n",
        "column, you should select appropriate names. The naming conventions can\n",
        "vary between databases. For a SQLite database, individual names:\n",
        "\n",
        "- by default, case insensitive (although this can be changed),\n",
        "\n",
        "- are unlimited in length, but should be kept to a reasonable length\n",
        "(given readability constraints),\n",

        "Related tables are often grouped together into a schema. You can think\n",

        "indicate the correct schema. For other databases, however, this is not\n",
        "the case. For these databases, you specify the schema name followed by a\n",

        "the products table in the bigdog schema. Without the relevant schema\n",
