ADRs account for 4.9--7.7\\% of hospital admissions and are a leading cause of death in the U.S. Moreover, vulnerable populations face high risks -- 39\\% of ADRs in pediatric patients end up being life--threatening or fatal and 11.4--35.5\\% of geriatric hospital admissions are due to drug--related incidences. Incidence of ADRs in the USA are estimated to cost up to 30.1 billion dollars annually due to  increased hospitalization, prolongation of hospital stay, and visits to emergency departments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Approximately 10--15\\% of ADRs are dose-independent and idiosyncratic (IADRS), which makes them notoriously difficult to plan for and unable to be evaded by simple dose adjustments. IADRs occur at very low frequencies of 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100,000, allowing them to evade detection until the drug has gained increased exposure at large population levels that are not tractable in clinical trials. IADRs commonly affect the skin, blood cells, and especially the liver. At least 17\\% of liver transplant cases and 50\\% of acute liver failure cases can be traced to IADRs. Consequently, IADRs are a major reason for drug clinical trial termination and drug-induced liver injury, which is the leading cause of drug withdrawal from the market. Partly due to a poor ability to screen early on for IADRs, one in five drugs that has been on the market for at least two years ends up being withdrawn or tagged with a black box warning. Metabolic activation of an extraneous drug, or xenobiotic, into a reactive metabolite, is a common precursor of ADRs."

A greedy approach selects the most probable metabolites at each search step, but is problematic because it is impossible to know a priori which chosen metabolite will lead to the more promising future. The effect of choosing a metabolite may not be obvious until several search steps later and early choice of the wrong metabolite may cumulatively lead to a poorer overall path probability over time. Performing an exhaustive search, retaining all choices, and forking the network with every possible molecule under consideration at a given step rapidly blows up. Instead, retain only the top $N$ scoring forks at each search step. We choose the top $N$ based on the product of probabilities of all metabolites along the path constructed so far.\n",
